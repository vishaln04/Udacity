# Udacity

This repository consist of my android learning on [**Udacity nanodegree**](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

*BirthdayCard* - It is one layout Birthday Card to wish your loving one.

*Coffee Challenge* - It is challenge by Udacity and the correct anwers to that quiz.

*JustJava App* - It is basically a coffee ordering app which allows user to order coffee with different flavors and number of cups he/she wants via an email. This app is Language compatible so that if your mobile system language is set to be **Marathi** then the app is shown in Marathi language.

*LangConveter* - May be the name is misleading because the app is not convert one language to another rather it has some Numbers, Colors, Family members name and Phrases in **English** and it teaches the **Miwok** translation of the same. The interensting thing while making the app is handling *Audiofocus*, how it works and what to do when other interruption like phone call, message/whatsapp notification or song comes.
